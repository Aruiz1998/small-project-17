            Notes:
            To save future Marc's explanation, basically, his contact.html uses some bootstrap
            elements, so it has to reference the bootstrap.css
            However, that actually messes with Santiago's html that he worked on (index and register)
            Actually, nothing in Santiago's work uses bootstrap elements so realistically there
            is no point in referencing the bootstrap.css in the index and register.html
            However, when trying to style it the same way in contact.html
            referencing the bootstrap.css, for some reason, it just doesn't work the same
            (If group asks for example, inspect the html elements)
            I've attempted to search for workarounds, but nothing was found

            Update, one of things that bothered me, I found a really simple solution
            and now I'm upset

            As for the IDs for each of the elements, go over with Alex on naming convention

                Some notes here:
                Contacts will most likely be deleted as it doesn't seem logical
                to have the user access it when they aren't logged in.

            Originally, form was being used here, however

            Not sure how that will work, might just be easier to have a button that calls
            the JS function
            (atleast from what I read, its like 6am cut me some slack future Marc)
